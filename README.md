## The process of software development
### Correctly Determining the Demands
It is one of the first and most important criteria of software development.
### Planning and Project Analysis
- The main modules required by the project were analyzed, the project objectives and objectives were detailed.
- The benefits of the project for the user were evaluated.
- The software language to be used, software architecture, server requirements, methods to be followed during the project process have been determined. the personnel division of labor was carried out and elements such as the distribution of project steps to the process were evaluated.
- The needs and functions of the system were extracted in detail.
- It was clearly determined what exactly was required of the software product that was to be developed.
### Design and Coding
- The required modules were designed and their usefulness was analyzed.
- It was aimed that the user could reach the desired page with a maximum of 3 clicks.
- Care has been taken to ensure that the designs are simple and user-friendly designs.
- Programming was carried out using the coding technique, which is simple, readable and easy to maintain.
### Test
- Tests were carried out to determine whether the pre-determined requirements were met, whether they produced the correct output, or not.
- Security tests were carried out and the openings in the system were closed.
### Maintenance
- After completing all the stages of software development and making it available to the user, this is the stage of updating failures or problems that will occur during the use of the project.
- This cycle is very important for a healthy and long-term study.
- The targeted situation is to ensure the uninterrupted and desired operation of the manufactured software.
